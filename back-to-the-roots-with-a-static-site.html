Oh, yeah ðŸ¤£</p><p>After acquiring a basic level of understanding, the real deal was to confront this nightmare,&nbsp;<code>the code</code> ðŸ‘»<br>From where should I begin ?!<br>What should I learn first ?!<br>How to create a website ?!<br>...<br>So many questions with no clear answer for me ðŸ˜±&nbsp;</p><p>Since I wanted to start quick (newbie error), I took the wrong path and started to seek for easy ways to create a website (don't want to talk about it, very bad memory). It took me a while to realise that this was not a good choice and that I'm not really learning...<br>A friend talked about a tool for creating dynamic websites called Joomla, I created my first website with Joomla and coded a little bit, but Joomla was (for me) illogical (not clear/consistent), so I tried Drupal (a cannon to kill a fly), then discovered WordPress ðŸ’˜</p><p>I don't know why, but I felled at home with WordPress, especially with the Codex, the Forums and tons of tutorials everywhere on the Web, the nightmare was turning to a dream coming true...<br>Meanwhile, my English was improving with all the readings and my experience was getting pleasant and smoother.<br>So I decided to make <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/" target="_blank">my first plugin</a> (2016), then <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/the-clean-blog/" target="_blank">my first theme</a> (2017), and I did it with a lot of difficulties... I wanted to quit many times, but a voice in my head was telling me: "continue, you've already spent a lot of time over this and you are so close, don't give up now !".</p><p>Since then, I've helped as much as I can other people, the same way great developers helped me by pointing to the right direction.<br>But, yes there is always a but, I've written again my plugin and my theme from ground up, because I was improving, and everything with bells and whistles in the code world became (for me) useless.<br>I was turning to usability over functionality, simplicity over complexity and accessibility over bling bling code !</p><p>Last year (2019), I was watching a lot of great developers turning their personal sites to static and a growing interest for <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank">SSG</a> and <a href="https://headlesscms.org/" target="_blank">headlesCMS</a> .<br>I was wondering why ?<br>I had a .tk domain that stopped working from one day to the next ! Another lesson in this world...<br>So, it was time to turn over and try the static world. I've found myself in a completely new playground and didn't want to waste time, again, just to output basic HTML...</p><p>I was working on a new WordPress theme, and decided to bake it on the Classic Road and use it for me as a beginning point to my new site.<br>Big, bold and clear ðŸ˜‰&nbsp;</p><p>I really hope that you like it. Soon I'll be talking about how I made it, stay tuned !</p></div><div id="author-bio"><p>SYA,<br>LebCit.</p></div><nav id="post-navigation"><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/full-screen-morphing-search-plugin.html" class="prev-post" rel="prev">&larr; Previous (Full Screen Morphing Search Plugin) </a><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/about.html" class="next-post" rel="next">Next (About Me) &rarr;</a></nav><div id="related-posts"><h3>SOME RELATED POSTS</h3><div><section><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/creating-a-customizer-control-with-javascript.html"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lebcit.github.io/media/posts/12/screenshot-creating-a-customizer-control-with-javascript.png" loading="lazy" height="626" width="1366" alt=""></a><h4><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/creating-a-customizer-control-with-javascript.html">Creating a Customizer control with JavaScript</a></h4></section><section><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/hide-wordpress-toolbar-with-wp_add_inline_style.html"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lebcit.github.io/media/posts/8/little_girl_hidding_face-by-Caleb_Woods.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt=""></a><h4><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/hide-wordpress-toolbar-with-wp_add_inline_style.html">Hide WordPress Toolbar with wp_add_inline_style</a></h4></section></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer unit-1"></footer></div></div><script async src="https://lebcit.github.io/assets/js/scripts.js?v=d8709fa0ed7b5cb59eac2a973692919a"></script></body></html>
