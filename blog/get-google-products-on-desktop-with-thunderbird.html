                                check your Gmail, Agenda, Drive, Keep... on your
                                desktop, you have to open a browser and log in,
                                to be able use them.<br />Did you ever asked
                                your self how much time this process is taking
                                in a week, a month, a year ?<br />Well, with
                                Thunderbird you will not ask yourself that
                                anymore !

                                &emsp; I'm not going to explain in this post how
                                to install Thunderbird, but you can just go to
                                <a
                                    href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/"

                                and download it, the installation process is
                                <strong>very</strong> easy.<br />&emsp; So,
                                assuming you have Thunderbird installed and
                                running, I'm going to explain how to get all
                                Google products directly inside it, and it's
                                also very easy to do it.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Profile or profiles</h2>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; When you install Thunderbird and run it,
                                a default profile will be created. You can
                                access the profiles' manager by typing this
                                command :
                            </p>
                            <pre>thunderbird.exe -p</pre>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; You'll then be able to do various
                                actions, as adding, renaming, deleting... a
                                profile and so on...<br />This is not a part of
                                the process but it's important to know that you
                                can do it, maybe you want to add a profile for
                                your work and another for you üòâ this is a very
                                convenient way to separate your personal stuff
                                üëç<br />&emsp; Once a profile is created, start
                                it, add your name (as you want to display it for
                                this account), your e-mail, and your password,
                                and that's it !<br /><strong
                                    >&emsp; Important note </strong
                                >if you use multiple profiles (or even one if
                                you want) :<br />you don't have to type the
                                above command each time you want to access the
                                manager, just untick the
                                <em>Don't ask at startup</em> box and now you'll
                                get the manager every time you launch
                                Thunderbird.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Google products</h2>
                            <p>
                                &emsp; The easiest way is to add only one
                                plugin. To add an extension in Thunderbird,
                                click the main menu button, choose
                                <strong>Add-ons</strong>, then
                                <strong>Extensions</strong> in the left panel,
                                search for <em>ThunderKeepPlus</em> and install
                                it.<br />&emsp; Once installed, it will ask you
                                to connect to your Google account, after that
                                your Google Keep will be displayed, in a new tab
                                inside Thunderbird, as if it was in a browser
                                and you will have access to all Google products
                                as you usually do in a browser üí™

                                &emsp; I don't have to tell you to be aware of
                                this technique because you should only do it on
                                your personal machine only, but I'm telling you
                                just for security and conscience reasons üòä
