                                Users, like I was a long time ago, tend to
                                search for themes with ‘cool’ functionalities to
                                make their websites stand out without knowing
                                the real cost (performance, accessibility, best
                                practices, search engine optimization, and so
                                on…) of the ‘bling-bling’ they are using…<br />
                                Two years ago, when <em>The Clean Blog</em> was
                                released (in 2017), I was not aware of those
                                critical facts and developed it with a user
                                mindset…<br />Today (in 2019), after two more
                                years of diving, learning and improving, I can’t
                                just sit back and let even a few hundreds of
                                people use a bloated theme with a lot of
                                ‘bling-bling’ functionalities !<br />
                                As developers improve, they don’t feel shy or
                                ashamed at all to point users in the right
                                direction(s) for a better experience and a
                                better Web even if this mean hours of developing
                                are going to be wasted ( not really because we
                                learn from our mistakes ) and gone with the
                                wind…<br />
                                Users are always free to switch from a theme to
                                any other one, but for me, as a conscientious
                                developer, I have to make the best decisions
                                concerning my code for the web and the users
                                experience…<br />
                                In short, the new theme is much more well coded
                                and to be very honest is not bloated like the
                                old one…

                                2- Since the theme is Bootstrap based, I've

                                created menu, choose <strong>Primary</strong> as
                                location and save your menu<br />- nothing more
                                to do, that's it ! 😁
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3- In the Customizer (<em
                                    >Appearance&rarr;Customize</em
                                >
                                or <em>Customize</em> link in the Admin Bar),
                                you'll find a panel named
                                <em>The Clean Blog Theme</em> and four sections
                                (for now:
                                <em
                                    >Homepage Header Slider, Featured Image
                                    Display, Footer Social Sites Links and
                                    Footer Copyright Area</em
                                >) under it. Under each section, controls are
                                explained in details.<br />
                                Note that the third section
                                <em>Header Image</em> is only for the home page,
                                each post and page can have their own header
                                image by assigning a <em>Featured image</em> to
                                the post or the page.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                4- The only plugin I've used is

                                to control the size of the site title, so don't
                                worry if your site title is long, it will be big
                                and bold ✨
