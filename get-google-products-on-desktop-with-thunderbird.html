You can access the profiles' manager by typing this command :</p><pre class="line-numbers language-html"><code>thunderbird.exe -p</code></pre><p>You'll then be able to do various actions, as adding, renaming, deleting... a profile and so on...<br>This is not a part of the process but it's important to know that you can do it, maybe you want to add a profile for your work and another for you üòâ this is a very convenient way to separate your personal stuff üëç<br></p><p>Once a profile is created, start it, add your name (as you want to display it for this account), your e-mail, and your password, and that's it !<br></p><p><strong>Important note</strong> if you use multiple profiles (or even one if you want) :<br>you don't have to type the above command each time you want to access the manager, just untick the <em>Don't ask at startup</em> box and now you'll get the manager every time you launch Thunderbird.</p><h2 id="google-products">Google products</h2><p>The easiest way is to add only one plugin. To add an extension in Thunderbird, click the main menu button, choose <b>Add-ons</b>, then <b>Extensions</b> in the left panel, search for <i>ThunderKeepPlus</i> and install it.</p><p>Once installed, it will ask you to connect to your Google account, after that your Google Keep will be displayed, in a new tab inside Thunderbird, as if it was in a browser and you will have access to all Google products as you usually do in a browser üí™</p><h2 id="security-">Security !</h2><p>I don't have to tell you to be aware of this technique because you should only do it on your personal machine only, but I'm telling you just for security and conscience reasons üòä&nbsp;</p><h2 id="final-note">Final note</h2><p>If you want to know more about Thunderbird, head over <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/thunderbird" target="_blank">the official support</a>, everything is well explained.</p><hr class="separator separator--dots"><p class="hide"><em>Note: background image used, work of <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/417303" target="_blank">Les Haines</a></em></p><p>Hope this was helpful.</p></div><div id="author-bio"><p>SYA,<br>LebCit.</p></div><nav id="post-navigation"><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/the-clean-blog-wordpress-theme.html" class="prev-post" rel="prev">&larr; Previous (The Clean Blog WordPress theme) </a><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/modifying-wordpress-themes-copyright-from-the-customizer.html" class="next-post" rel="next">Next (Modifying WordPress theme&#x27;s copyright from the Customizer) &rarr;</a></nav><div id="related-posts"><h3>SOME RELATED POSTS</h3><div><section><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/clear-your-local-development-cache-with-js.html"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lebcit.github.io/media/posts/11/memories-jon-tyson.jpg" loading="lazy" height="480" width="640" alt=""></a><h4><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/clear-your-local-development-cache-with-js.html">Clear your local development cache with JS</a></h4></section><section><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/hide-wordpress-toolbar-with-wp_add_inline_style.html"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lebcit.github.io/media/posts/8/little_girl_hidding_face-by-Caleb_Woods.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt=""></a><h4><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/hide-wordpress-toolbar-with-wp_add_inline_style.html">Hide WordPress Toolbar with wp_add_inline_style</a></h4></section></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer unit-1"></footer></div></div><script async src="https://lebcit.github.io/assets/js/scripts.js?v=d8709fa0ed7b5cb59eac2a973692919a"></script></body></html>
