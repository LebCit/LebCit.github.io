						<p>
							From Zero to Hero or at least not a zero anymore!<br />From the Highway to the Classic Road.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you didn&#39;t read my <a href="/pages/about">About</a> section, you can quickly guess
							from the tagline that I&#39;m a self-taught developer.
						</p>
						<p>
							I didn&#39;t have a clue about the amazing world of code, or even heard about HTML, CSS or
							JS. So with a will to understand, after being played and robbed by a so-called
							<em>developer</em>, my first task was to learn English! Oh, yeah ðŸ¤£
						</p>
						<p>
							After acquiring a basic level of understanding, the real deal was to confront this
							nightmare, <code>the code</code> ðŸ‘»<br />From where should I begin?!<br />What should I
							learn first?!<br />How to create a website?!<br />...<br />So many questions with no clear
							answer for me ðŸ˜±
						</p>
						<p>
							Since I wanted to start quick (newbie error), I took the wrong path and started to seek for
							easy ways to create a website (don&#39;t want to talk about it, very bad memory). It took me
							a while to realise that this was not a good choice and that I&#39;m not really
							learning...<br />A friend talked about a tool for creating dynamic websites called Joomla, I
							created my first website with Joomla and coded a little bit, but Joomla was (for me)
							illogical (not clear/consistent), so I tried Drupal (a cannon to kill a fly), then
							discovered WordPress.
						</p>
						<p>
							I don&#39;t know why, but I felled at home with WordPress, especially with the Codex, the
							Forums and tons of tutorials everywhere on the Web, the nightmare was turning to a dream
							coming true...<br />Meanwhile, my English was improving with all the readings and my
							experience was getting pleasant and smoother.<br />So I decided to make
							<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/">my first plugin</a>
							(2016), then
							<a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/the-clean-blog/">my first theme</a> (2017), and I did
							it with <strong>a lot of difficulties</strong>... I wanted to quit many times, but a voice
							in my head was telling me: &quot;<em
								>continue, you&#39;ve already spent a lot of time over this and you are so close,
								don&#39;t give up now!</em
							>&quot;.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since then, I&#39;ve helped as much as I can other people, the same way great developers
							helped me by pointing to the right direction.<br />But, yes there is always a but, I&#39;ve
							written again my plugin and my theme from ground up, because I was improving, and everything
							with bells and whistles in the code world became (for me) useless.<br />I was turning to
							usability over functionality, simplicity over complexity and accessibility over bling bling
							code!
						</p>
						<p>
							Last year (2019), I was watching a lot of great developers turning their personal sites to
							static and a growing interest for
							<a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">Static Site Generators</a> and
							<a href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/">Headless CMS</a>.<br />I was wondering why?<br />I
							had a .tk domain that stopped working from one day to the next! Another lesson in this
							world...<br />So, it was time to turn over and try the static world. I&#39;ve found myself
							in a completely new playground and didn&#39;t want to waste time, again, just to output
							basic HTML (another newbie error)...<br />After trying to totally code my site without an
							SSG, I figured out that it was a time killer and surely not the best way today.<br />Coming
							from WordPress, I wanted a CMS to output my site, so I&#39;ve tried
							<a href="https://jocms.net/">jocms</a> and <a href="https://getpublii.com/">Publii</a> but I
							was not satisfied at all by the result nor the limitations...<br />In 2021, after trying
							some SSG, I found <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, reputed for it&#39;s
							freedom, power and simplicity.<br />Interesting post:
							<a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator"
								>Choosing the Best Static Site Generator</a
							>.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was working on a new WordPress theme, and decided to bake it on the Classic Road and use
							it for me as a beginning point to my new site.<br />Big, bold and clear ðŸ˜‰
						</p>
						<p>I really hope that you like it.</p>
