						<h2>Response to ivanmontillam comments</h2>

						<p>
							The first

						<pre><code class="language-txt">ivanmontillam
&gt; Aether sits in the sweet spot: simple enough for content creators, flexible enough for developers, fast enough for users.
A thing that most other developers miss is that non-technical people, like (and especially) content creators, shy away from a terminal as if it were such a plague.
Some of them don&#39;t even have the mind concept of a directory tree, from a root drive to nested ones.
Therefore, if you have to `cd` to a directory and then `npm run build` it, yeah: the CMS is developer-oriented no matter what you claim. Once your Windows customer tries to run that command (assuming they know what `cmd.exe` is) they&#39;ll run into `&#39;npm&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`. If it&#39;s a Linux person, they may find `node` and `npm` installed, but then it&#39;s closer to a developer than the pure content creator this is trying to target.
These products seriously need to compete with the 5-minute WordPress installation. I&#39;m no WP fan, I really don&#39;t, but I give credit to its low-friction onboarding.
&gt; Aether stores everything as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.
Yeah, just like GravCMS[0]. Full disclosure: I&#39;m a Grav user.
Except that Grav has a web admin interface: now, that is more approachable to a non-technical content creator than typing commands in a terminal.
I really don&#39;t want to make my comment feel like a rant, but it&#39;s very hard to ignore that some devs entirely miss the target public they intend to approach.

							I appreciate your comment but feel like you didn&#39;t check the
							<a href="https://aether-cms.pages.dev/">Aether documentation</a> at all. As todotask2
							perfectly outlined in his response on your comment:
						</p>
						<pre><code class="language-txt">todotask2
For a 5-minute WordPress installation, you still need shared hosting and a domain name. Not every non-technical person knows how to handle the basic setup — including domain registration or choosing an affordable hosting provider. After that, it only takes one minute with a one-click installer.
Next, optimizing themes and hardening security add another layer of complexity, let alone learning Full-site editing.
There are many questions posted daily on r/Wordpress (&quot;p&quot; in lower case because they can&#39;t fix it on Reddit) — some users are able to fix the issues themselves, while others seek help. So WordPress has never been easier than using a modern static site generator (SSG).
The terminal isn&#39;t that hard — what&#39;s harder is that there’s more than one way to run it.
</code></pre>
						<p>
							I can add to that: if Wordpress is a 5 minutes installation, Aether is 30 seconds installed
							and running!
						</p>
						<p>
							You may not like the terminal but if copying and pasting one command in a terminal is so
							difficult, then Aether does - unfortunately - not meet your requirements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also, Aether has a protected
							<a href="https://aether-cms.pages.dev/documentation/user-interface/dashboard/"
								>admin interface</a
							>
							as any other CMS, like DoctorOW outlined in his response to your comment:
						</p>
						<pre><code class="language-txt">DoctorOW
&gt; The admin interface feels familiar if you&#39;ve used any modern CMS, but it&#39;s built with one goal: get out of your way. Write in Markdown, see a live preview, hit publish.
The static site is optional, you can send to use the web interface if inclined.

ivanmontillam
Yeah, I missed that, my bad.
But my point still stands, I checked the repo and this is too advanced[0] for anyone not a developer.

DoctorOW
Ah, I was giving deployment a pass since this is self hosted software. WordPress&#39;s GUI install only works if the LAMP stack is already setup properly. It&#39;s only fair to presuppose Aether has its requirements already in place as well.
</code></pre>
						<p>
							Finally, I didn&#39;t miss the target public,
							<em>Aether is a developer-first CMS and static site generator (SSG)</em>, but even that
							isn&#39;t an obstacle for copy/paste a command in a terminal. Please read the book before
							judging its content.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44201467">comment of tomrod</a> in
							this thread, I can just say that you are most welcome 🤣
						</p>
						<p>
							The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44200905">comment of lenova</a> responded
							to cluckindan comment on Aether not being a CMS. As for the part were cluckindan says that
							the SSG is not optional, I can just say that cluckindan didn&#39;t read the docs...<br />Also
							in lenova&#39;s comment, ivanmontillam says that YAML is hard to use and is not an
							innovative or attractive as a feature. My response here is that you don&#39;t have to know
							or use YAML, it&#39;s auto-generated.<br />An advice to ivanmontillam: stop criticizing
							technologies that you don&#39;t understand or haven&#39;t read related material. Developers
							are kind people offering time and knowledge for free. So respect their efforts, don&#39;t
							use their solution(s), search for an alternative that suits your needs, or provide a better
							one if you can.

						<h2>Response to CSSer comment</h2>

						<p>
							Thanks for the kind and encouraging words.
							<a href="https://aether-cms.pages.dev/documentation/user-interface/editor/"
								>The Aether Editor</a
							>
							does already take care of some aspects you mentioned.
						</p>
						<h2>Response to nobleach comment</h2>

						<p>
							Scheduled content release is on the roadmap. You can store drafts already. You can preview
							your content on your site. Feel like you didn&#39;t read the book also.
						</p>
						<h2>Response to dnrvs comment</h2>

						<p>Did you know that you can save files to a database if you need too?</p>
						<h2>Response to exiguus comment</h2>

						<p>
							If you have the ability to know the content of a book by it&#39;s cover, then you&#39;ll
							know what Aether CMS is just by it&#39;s title.
						</p>
						<h2>Response to LunaSea comment</h2>

						<p>
							Hugo and Zola are not CMSs, they are static site generators (SSGs). Aether is a CMS
							including an integrated, optional, and ready to use SSG with one click.
						</p>
						<p>Aether SSG build my static site</p>
						<h2>Final Words</h2>

						<p>
							Aether is years of experience and real-world usage. A personal response built from the
							ground up with simplicity in mind, showing that we can do more with less, aiming to strike
							the perfect balance between developer empowerment and user-friendliness.
