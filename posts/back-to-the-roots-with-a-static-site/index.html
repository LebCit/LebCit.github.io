  <p><em>This is a post about my own experience with development and static site.</em></p>
<p>From Zero to Hero or at least not a zero anymore !<br>
From the Highway to the Classic Road.</p>
<p>If you didn't read my <a href="/about/">About</a> section, you can quickly guess from the tagline that I'm a self-taught developer.</p>
<p>I didn't have a clue about the amazing world of code, or even heard about HTML, CSS or JS.<br>
So with a will to understand, after being played and robbed by a so-called <em>developer</em>, my first task was to learn English ! Oh, yeah ðŸ¤£</p>
<p>After acquiring a basic level of understanding, the real deal was to confront this nightmare, <code>the code</code> ðŸ‘»<br>
From where should I begin ?!<br>
What should I learn first ?!<br>
How to create a website ?!<br>
...<br>
So many questions with no clear answer for me ðŸ˜±</p>
<p>Since I wanted to start quick (newbie error), I took the wrong path and started to seek for easy ways to create a website (don't want to talk about it, very bad memory). It took me a while to realise that this was not a good choice and that I'm not really learning...<br>
A friend talked about a tool for creating dynamic websites called Joomla, I created my first website with Joomla and coded a little bit, but Joomla was (for me) illogical (not clear/consistent), so I tried Drupal (a cannon to kill a fly), then discovered WordPress ðŸ’˜</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I felled at home with WordPress, especially with the Codex, the Forums and tons of tutorials everywhere on the Web, the nightmare was turning to a dream coming true...<br>
Meanwhile, my English was improving with all the readings and my experience was getting pleasant and smoother.<br>
So I decided to make <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-screen-morphing-search/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">my first plugin</a> (2016), then <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/the-clean-blog/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">my first theme</a> (2017), and I did it with <strong>a lot of difficulties</strong>... I wanted to quit many times, but a voice in my head was telling me: &quot;<em>continue, you've already spent a lot of time over this and you are so close, don't give up now !</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Since then, I've helped as much as I can other people, the same way great developers helped me by pointing to the right direction.<br>
But, yes there is always a but, I've written again my plugin and my theme from ground up, because I was improving, and everything with bells and whistles in the code world became (for me) useless.<br>
I was turning to usability over functionality, simplicity over complexity and accessibility over bling bling code !</p>
<p>Last year (2019), I was watching a lot of great developers turning their personal sites to static and a growing interest for <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Static Site Generators</a> and <a href="https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Headless CMS</a>.<br>
I was wondering why ?<br>
I had a .tk domain that stopped working from one day to the next ! Another lesson in this world...<br>
So, it was time to turn over and try the static world. I've found myself in a completely new playground and didn't want to waste time, again, just to output basic HTML (another newbie error)...<br>
After trying to totally code my site without an SSG, I figured out that it was a time killer and surely not the best way today.<br>
Coming from WordPress, I wanted a CMS to output my site, so I've tried <a href="https://jocms.net/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">jocms</a> and <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Publii</a> but I was not satisfied at all by the result nor the limitations...<br>
Now (2021), after trying some SSG, I deeply felled in love with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Eleventy</a> ðŸ’˜, the best SSG in my opinion, for it's freedom, power and simplicity.<br>
Interesting post : <a href="https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Choosing the Best Static Site Generator</a>.</p>
<p>I was working on a new WordPress theme, and decided to bake it on the Classic Road and use it for me as a beginning point to my new site.<br>
Big, bold and clear ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>I really hope that you like it. Soon I'll be making comments available and be talking about how I made it, so stay tuned !</p>
