Under each section, controls are explained in details.<br>Note that the third section <em>Header Image</em> is only for the home page, each post and page can have their own header image by assigning a <em>Featured image</em> to the post or the page.</p><p>4- The only plugin I've used is <a href="https://freqdec.github.io/slabText/" target="_blank">slabText</a> by <a href="https://github.com/freqdec" target="_blank">Brian McAllister</a> to control the size of the site title, so don't worry if your site title is long, it will be big and bold ‚ú®</p><p>5- The Clean Blog (TCB) is a Responsive WordPress theme, perfect for personal or company blogs.</p><h2 id="feedback-">Feedback ?</h2><p>Head over the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/theme/the-clean-blog" target="_blank">support page</a> to tell me if you‚Äôre having some issues or if you wish to see some features added to the theme üòâ<br>You can also leave a review on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/theme/the-clean-blog/reviews/" target="_blank">reviews page</a> to give me a push üëç<br>Thanks in advance for your feedback !</p><h2 id="final-word">Final word</h2><p>I really hope that this theme will be useful for a lot of WordPress users and that they'll enjoy using it. I'll be making improvements to TCB from time to time, so don't worry, and be talking about it here, so stay tuned !</p></div><div id="author-bio"><p>SYA,<br>LebCit.</p></div><nav id="post-navigation"><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/about.html" class="prev-post" rel="prev">&larr; Previous (About Me) </a><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/get-google-products-on-desktop-with-thunderbird.html" class="next-post" rel="next">Next (Get Google products on desktop with Thunderbird) &rarr;</a></nav><div id="related-posts"><h3>SOME RELATED POSTS</h3><div><section><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/hide-wordpress-toolbar-with-wp_add_inline_style.html"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lebcit.github.io/media/posts/8/little_girl_hidding_face-by-Caleb_Woods.jpg" loading="lazy" height="683" width="1024" alt=""></a><h4><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/hide-wordpress-toolbar-with-wp_add_inline_style.html">Hide WordPress Toolbar with wp_add_inline_style</a></h4></section><section><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/modifying-wordpress-themes-copyright-from-the-customizer.html"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://lebcit.github.io/media/posts/7/copyright-under-magnifying-glass.jpg" loading="lazy" height="848" width="1280" alt=""></a><h4><a href="https://lebcit.github.io/modifying-wordpress-themes-copyright-from-the-customizer.html">Modifying WordPress theme&#x27;s copyright from the Customizer</a></h4></section></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer unit-1"></footer></div></div><script async src="https://lebcit.github.io/assets/js/scripts.js?v=d8709fa0ed7b5cb59eac2a973692919a"></script></body></html>
